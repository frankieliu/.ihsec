This message is to announce the availability of Skill-mode 3.2
production version for XEmacs/GnuEmacs V19, where at least 19.11/19.28
is required. GnuEmacs19.30 is possible to use but has some flaws (e.g
in the menu system). XEmacs19.13 and GnuEmacs19.28 are the recommeded
versions to run on. Both Emacses has identical functionality although
the XEmacs implementation is slightly more solid and with the nicer
user interface.

Changes since 3.1
=================

** The tree browser: The sluggish re-scans is now done less often. By
the use of a new option, il-tree_rescan-trigger, re-scan is deferred
until N new functions has been added. The browser switch has been
remolded to a "Tree" minor mode and all associated options has been
renamed from the `move-' to the `tree_' prefix and has moved to the
"Tree" minor mode menu entry.

** New function category: `temporary function' that only exists within
current session. Any `unknown fun' now becomes `temporary' if you decline
the prototype query, or if the make-prototype switch is turned off.
Thus, all unknown fun calls is recorded provided that arghelp mode is active.
A new corresponding completion command has been added.

** New option: il-syntax-blink-time, controls the blink time for
matching parenthesis & double-quote. Previously, the blink time was
hard-coded to 1 sec which was a bit slow. Default is now 0.2 sec.

** Syntax warnings when visiting working files is output to a separate
window without any additional delays. The messages "Probably unbalanced
parentheses" and "Extraneous closing parenth" has been replaced with
"End-of-fun regexp mismatch".

** The "Submit-Bug-Report" command now includes help on how to create
backtrace listings for inclusion in the bug report.

** Help windows of Emacs standard commands is now always half a screen,
regardless of any previous skill-mode help windows.

** Updated User's manual.

** Cleaned-up "Customize All" command.

** Cleaned-up README file for the gateToOpus package.

** skill-append/prepend hook-in files modified to work properly with
AUC-TeX, ie. to always insert the skill/ dir directly under site-lisp/
