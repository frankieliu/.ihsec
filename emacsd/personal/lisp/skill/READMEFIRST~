This is an updated version of the Emacs/Xemacs SKILL mode.  The changes are
to make the tools work with release 21 of those editors.  Also a database
of symbols generated from the cdsFinder database for release 4.4 has been
added.  If you are still using 4.3, you will need to edit the skill-defaults.el
file and modify the il-symbol-lib-version and then recompile it.

The major changes have been in the skill-mode.elc files in the respective
xemacs and gnuemacs directory.  There was a problem where the test was
being made for the release number being equal to 19.  I changed the test
and we now have a skill-mode19.elc and a skill-mode21.elc for the
respective versions of the editors.  Copy the one which cooresponds to your
version of the editor to skill-mode.elc and then follow the INSTALL
instructions.

Cadence does not supply support for this project, I did these things for
myself since the original developer has not updated the code.  If you have
any comments, you may send them to me.  However, I do not have source code
so I cannot fix any problems.
