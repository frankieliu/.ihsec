Known Bugs in 3.1

Typing "(eval " using lisp syntax frequently doesn't give any arg-help.

Quote match doesnt work on exprs like "sdflkj\"" with two adjacent
quotes.

Completion of local vars slower if done from inside an argument list
when writing a function call.  Due to temporarily unbalanced
parentheses which makes var scanning harder.
